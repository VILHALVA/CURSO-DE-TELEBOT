Hello %s üëãüèº, nice to meet you!
I'm Group Butler, the first administration bot using the official Bot API.

*I can do a lot of cool stuffs*, here's a short list:
‚Ä¢ I can *kick or ban* users
‚Ä¢ You can use me to set the group rules
‚Ä¢ I have a flexible *anti-flood* system
‚Ä¢ I can *welcome new users* with a customizable message, or if you want with a gif or a sticker
‚Ä¢ I can *warn* users, and ban them when they reach the maximum number of warnings
‚Ä¢ I can also warn, kick or ban users when they post a specific media
‚Ä¶and more, below you can find the "all commands" button to get the whole list!

I work better if you add me to the group administrators (otherwise I won't be able to kick or ban)!

`/setrealm` (*only for the group owner*): use the group as a realm. A realm can't have more than 60 members and must be a *private* supergroup.
Follow the instructions the bot will give you to associate a group (subgroup) to a realm.
`/subgroups`: get the list of the subgroups administrated by a realm. Can't be more than 6 for now.
`/remove`: choose a subgroup to remove from the realm subgroups.
`/send [message]`: broadcast a message to one or more subgroups.
`/setrules [rules]`: apply the rules to one (or more) of your groups.
`/pin [message]`: edit the last message generated with `/pin` in one or more groups.
`/adminlist`: get the adminlist of one of your subgroups.
`/id`: get the Telegram ID of one of your subgroups.
`/realm`: get some info about your realm.
`/add`: get the message to copy-paste in a group to add it to the subgroups of the realm.
`/ban [by username|by id|by forwarded message]`: ban the user from all of your subgroups.
*By forwarded message*: forward a message from the user in the realm and reply to it with `/ban`.
`/config`: manage the settings of one of your subgroups.
`/setlog` (forwarded from a channel): set the log channel for one or more of your subgroups. More info in the dedicated tab.
`/delrealm` (*only for the owner*): the group will no longer be used as a realm.

*Commands to use in a subgroup*
`/unpair` (*only for the owner*): remove the association between the group and its realm.

*Important*: realms are meant to be groups where their members administrate one or more associated groups. So in a realm you won't be able to use regular commands, such as `/warn`, `/welcome` and so on.
The only commands that will work are those that are described above.
Also, every member of the realm can take actions in groups where he is not admin. So take care about who to invite in a realm :)]])

*Banhammer powers*
A set of commands that let admins kick and ban people from a group, and get some information about an user.
Kicked people can join back, banned people can't. Banned users are added to the group blacklist

‚Ä¢ `/kick [by reply|username|id|text mention]`: kick a user from the group.
‚Ä¢ `/ban [by reply|username|id|text mention]`: ban a user from the group.
‚Ä¢ `/tempban [hours|nd nh]` = ban an user for a specific amount of hours (max: one week). For now, only by reply. Short form: `/tempban 1d 7h`
‚Ä¢ `/unban [by reply|username|id|text mention]`: unban the user from the group.
‚Ä¢ `/block`: this command can be used in reply to a forwarded message (from the user you want to block), or in alterantive you can provide a list of usernames. You should block only users who are outside the group.
Blocked users are *automatically* banned once they join the group.
‚Ä¢ `/unblock`: works in the same way of `/block`, but allows to remove one or more users from the list of blocked users.
‚Ä¢ `/blockedlist`: get the list of blocked users.
‚Ä¢ `/user [by reply|username|id|text mention]`: shows how many times the user has been banned *in all the groups*, and the warns received.
‚Ä¢ `/status [username|id]`: show the current status of the user `(member|kicked/left the chat|banned|admin/creator|never seen)`.
A bot can't retrieve the status of an user if that user never started it before (in this case, the _never seen_ status is returned)

*Antiflood*
The "antiflood" is a system that auto-removes people that send many consecutive messages in a group.
If on, the antiflood system will kick/ban flooders.

‚Ä¢ `/config` command, then `antiflood` button: manage the flood settings in private, with an inline keyboard. You can change the sensitivity, the action (kick/ban) to perform, and even set some exceptions.

*Note*: goodbye messages don't work in large groups. This is a Telegram limitation that can't be avoided.

*Custom welcome message*:
‚Ä¢ `/welcome Welcome $name, enjoy the group!`
Write after `/welcome` your welcome message. `/goodbye` works in the same way.

You can use some placeholders to include the name/username/id of the new member of the group
Placeholders:
`$username`: _will be replaced with the username_
`$name`: _will be replaced with the name_
`$id`: _will be replaced with the id_
`$title`: _will be replaced with the group title_
`$surname`: _will be replaced by the user's last name_
`$rules`: _will be replaced by a link to the rules of the group. Please read_ [here](https://telegram.me/GroupButler_beta/26) _how to use it, or you will get an error for sure_
*Note*: `$name`, `$surname`, and `$title` may not work properly within markdown markup.

As you may know, the bot can warn/kick/ban who sends a telegram.me link (antispam settings) or any other link (media settings).
The whitelist is a list of links that will be ignored by the bot.
If an user sends a whitelisted link, he won't be warned or kicked.

`/whitelist [link(s)]` or `/wl [link(s)]`: add one or more links to the whitelist.
`/unwhitelist [link(s)]` or `/unwl [link(s)]`: remove one or more links from the whitelist.
`/whitelist` or `/wl`: get the whitelist.
`/whitelistl -` or `/wl -`: empty the whitelist.

When the group link is saved with `/setlink`, it gets automatically added to the whitelist.

*Why links are saved without* _https://_ *and* _www_*?*
The bot auto-removes _https://, http:// and www_ from every link to reduce the possibility of having the same link saved twice.

*Extra commands*
#extra commands are a smart way to save your own custom commands.

‚Ä¢ `/extra [#trigger] [reply]`: set a reply to be sent when someone writes the trigger.
_Example_ : with "`/extra #hello Good morning!`", the bot will reply "Good morning!" each time someone writes #hello.
You can reply to a media (_photo, file, vocal, video, gif, audio_) with `/extra #yourtrigger` to save the #extra and receive that media each time you use # command
‚Ä¢ `/extra list`: get the list of your custom commands.
‚Ä¢ `/extra del [#trigger]`: delete the trigger and its message.

*Note:* the markdown is supported. If the text sent breaks the markdown, the bot will notify that something is wrong.

Now supports placeholders. Check the "welcome" tab for the list of the available placeholders
]])
	elseif key == 'warns' then
		return _([[
*Warns*
Warn are made to keep the count of the admonitions received by an user. Once an user has been warned for the defined number of times, he is kicked/banned by the bot.
There are two different type of warns:
- _normal warns_, given by an admin with the `/warn` command
- _automatic warns_ (read: media warns and spam warns), given by the bot when someone sends a media that is not allowed in the chat, or spams other channels or telegram.me links.

‚Ä¢ `/warn [by reply]`: warn a user
‚Ä¢ `/sw`: you can place a `/sw` (_"silent warn"_) everywhere you want in your message. The bot will silently count the warn, but won't answer in the group unless the user reached the max. number of warnings.
‚Ä¢ `/nowarns [by reply]`: reset the warns received by an user (both normal and automatic warns).
‚Ä¢ `/warnmax [number]`: set the max number of the warns before the kick/ban.
‚Ä¢ `/warnmax media [number]`: set the max number of the warns before kick/ban when an unallowed media is sent.

How to see how many warns a user has received (or to reset them): `/user` command.
How to change the max. number of warnings allowed: `/config` command, then `menu` button.
How to change the max. number of warnings allowed for medias: `/config` command, then `media` button.
How to change the max. number of warnings allowed for spam: `/config` command, then `antispam` button.

*Pinning messages*
The "48 hours limit" to edit your own messages doesn't apply to bots.
This command was born from the necessity of editing the pinned message without sending it again, maybe just to change few things.
So with `/pin` you can generate a message to pin, and edit it how many times you want.

‚Ä¢ `/pin [text]`: the bot will send you back the text you used as argument, with markdown. You can pin the message and use `/pin [text]` again to edit it
‚Ä¢ `/pin`: the bot will find the latest message generate by `/pin`, if it still exists

*Note*: `/pin` supports markdown, but only `$rules` and `$title` placeholders
]])
	elseif key == 'lang' then

*Group language*"
‚Ä¢ `/lang`: choose the group language (can be changed in private too).

*Note*: translators are volunteers, so I can't ensure the correctness of all the translations. And I can't force them to translate the new strings after each update (not translated strings are in english).

Anyway, translations are open to everyone. If you want to translate the bot, see an [information](https://github.com/RememberTheAir/GroupButler#translators) on GitHub.
Ask in the English /group for the `.po` file of your language.

*Special characters*

‚Ä¢ `/config` command, then `menu` button: you will receive in private the menu keyboard.
Here you will find two particular options: _Arab and RTL_.

*Arab*: when Arab it's not allowed (üö´), everyone who will write an arab character will be kicked from the group.
*Rtl*: it stands for 'Righ To Left' character, and it's the responsible of the weird service messages that are written in the opposite sense.
When Rtl is not allowed (üö´), everyone that writes this character (or that has it in his name) will be kicked.
]])
	elseif key == 'config' then

*General group settings*

`/config` or  `/settings`: manage the group settings in private from an inline keyboard.
The inline keyboard has six sub-menus:

*Menu*: manage the most important group settings
*Antiflood*: turn on or off the antiflood, set its sensitivity and choose some media to ignore, if you want
*Media*: choose which media to forbid in your group, and set the number of times that an user will be warned before being kicked/banned
*Antispam*: choose which kind of spam you want to forbid (example: telegram.me links, forwarded messages from channels)
*Log channel*: choose which updates should be logged
*Moderators*: promote or demote moderators

*Bonus commands*:
`/reportflood [number of messages]/[timeframe]`: set how many times users can use the @admin command within a certain timeframe.
`/leave`: the bot will leave the group without deleting its data. Use this command only if you are going to add the bot to the group again
`/snap`: generate a backup file that can be restored with `/import` (send the file in the group and reply to it). `/snap` can be used once every three days
]])
	elseif key == 'mods' then
		return _([[*Moderators*

Moderators are normal users that can use some of the commands that are usually available only to the group administrators.

By default, moderators only have the banhammer (they can use _/ban, /kick, /unban, /tempban, /warn, /nowarn, /block, /unblock, /user_).
But their powers can be expanded or restricted by the administrators: there is a button in the /config menu, called _"Moderators"_, where the permissions of the moderators can be configured.

By default, every admin can promote a new moderator, or demote an user who is already a mod.
If you are the group owner, in the _"Moderators"_ section of the configuration menu you will be able to find a switch called _"Admins can manage mods"_.
When disabled, the group administrators *can't promote or demote new moderators*, and also they won't be allowed to access the _"Moderators"_ section of the configuration menu (so they *won't be able to change the moderators permissions*).

*Commands*
`/promote [by reply|by username|by text mention|by ID]`: promote an user to moderator. If used on a moderator, it will update his name in the moderators list.
`/demote [by reply|by username|by text mention|by ID]`: demote an moderator.

A log channel is a _(private)_ channel where the bot will record all the important events that will happen in your group.
If you want to use this feature, you need to pair your group with a channel with the commands described below.
All the events, by default, are *not logged*. Admins can choose which events to log from the `/config` menu -> `log channel` button.

To pair a channel with a group, the *channel creator* must [add the bot to the channel administrators](telegram.me/gb_tutorials/4) (otherwise it won't be able to post), and send in the channel this command:
`/setlog`
Then, an admin of the group must forward in the group the message ("`/setlog`") sent in the channel. *Done*!
(you can find a video-tutorial [here](https://telegram.me/GB_tutorials/8))

A channel can be used as log by different groups.
To change your log channel, simply repeat this process with another channel.
